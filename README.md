Weather images created by Google

Gelion font designed by Deni Anggara

This is a weather app project, designed to familiarize myself with retrieving and displaying information gathered from an API.

It's able to search for a location, show weather information including images, and freely switch between imperial units and the metric system.

It was a lot of fun to make!
